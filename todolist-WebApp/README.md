💡 **Why This Project?**
AIPlanner TodoList was developed with the aim of making task management more efficient and personalized. Traditional to-do lists often lack the ability to adapt to users' changing priorities. With AIPlanner, we bridge this gap by harnessing the power of AI to tailor task suggestions to each user, creating a more productive and enjoyable task management experience.

🌱 **Continual Learning and Future Projects**
I'm committed to lifelong learning and expanding my horizons. Beyond this project, I'm eager to dive into new technologies, frameworks, and programming languages. I'm excited to tackle more ambitious projects that challenge me to think outside the box.
